# ðŸŽ® Sokoban Remastered
Sokoban is a classic puzzle game where the player has to push boxes onto designated drop-off areas. The player can only push one box at a time and cannot pull boxes. The player can move up, down, left, or right. In this implementation of Sokoban, the game features randomized, infinite, and progressively difficult levels through the use of object-oriented principles. The player can also reset the current level or generate a new level with the same number of boxes.
